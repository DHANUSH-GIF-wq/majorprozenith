At the very center lies the core, where nuclear fusion occurs at temperatures of 15 million degrees Celsius. This is where hydrogen atoms combine to form helium, releasing enormous amounts of energy. The radiative zone surrounds the core, where energy travels outward as electromagnetic radiation. Above that is the convective zone, where hot plasma rises and cooler material sinks, creating convection currents. The visible surface we see is called the photosphere, which appears as a bright disk in the sky.",

Sunspots are dark regions on the photosphere that appear when magnetic field lines become twisted and concentrated. These spots are cooler than the surrounding areas, making them appear darker. Solar flares are sudden, intense bursts of radiation that occur when magnetic energy is released. These can affect Earth's atmosphere and disrupt communications. Coronal mass ejections are massive eruptions of plasma and magnetic field that can travel through space and impact Earth, causing geomagnetic storms.",

It drives our planet's weather patterns through the heating of the atmosphere and oceans, creating wind currents and ocean circulation. The Sun's energy is essential for all life on Earth - plants use it for photosynthesis, which forms the base of the food chain. However, solar activity can also pose challenges to our technology.
