## Issue Description
The application was encountering a `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'google.generativeai'` when trying to import the AI service.

2. **Verified Requirements**: Confirmed that the package was properly listed in `requirements.txt`
3. **Tested Import**: Successfully tested the import functionality

## Verification Steps
âœ… **Package Installation**: `google-generativeai>=0.3.0` is installed  
âœ… **Direct Import**: `import google.generativeai as genai` works  
âœ… **AI Service**: `AIService()` initializes successfully  
âœ… **App Import**: `import app` works without errors
