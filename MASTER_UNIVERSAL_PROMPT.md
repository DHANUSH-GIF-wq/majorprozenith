# üé¨ Master Universal AI Prompt for Video Generation

## üéØ **What This Is**

This is the **universal AI prompt** that will:
- Take **any topic** with multiple **subtopics**
- Generate **video-ready slides** (one slide per subtopic)
- Each slide has **bullet points** (short text only, no clutter)
- The **narration expands on those points** in detail (not just reading the bullets)
- Slides are **clean, non-overlapping, properly spaced**, with consistent formatting
- **Optimized for video creation** with proper timing and flow

- timeline: Historical development and evolution (horizontal timeline, chronological reveal, 8 seconds)
- classification: Categorization and classification systems (hierarchical tree, category reveals, 8 seconds)
- principles: Core principles and fundamental concepts (card-based grid, principle highlights, 8 seconds)

## üìù SLIDE STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS

Each slide must include:
- title: clean, focused slide title (max 6 words, no questions)

- subtopic_type: one of the 8 types listed above
- timing: 8 seconds per slide for smooth video flow

## üé¨ VIDEO SLIDE TYPES TO INCLUDE
1. Title Slide: Topic introduction with clean, minimal design (8 seconds)
2. Overview: What will be covered (agenda-style, 8 seconds)
3. Introduction: What the topic is and why it matters (8 seconds)
4. Main Content Slides: Detailed explanations with varied subtopic types (8 seconds each)
5. Examples/Applications: Real-world usage and case studies (8 seconds)
6. Summary: Key takeaways and next steps (8 seconds)

## üìã OUTPUT FORMAT
Return ONLY valid JSON with this exact structure:
{
  "topic": "[YOUR_TOPIC]",
  "level": "[beginner/intermediate/advanced]",
  "slides": [
    {
      "title": "clean slide title",
      "subtopics": ["subtopic1", "subtopic2"],
      "bullets": ["bullet1", "bullet2", "bullet3"],
      "narration": "detailed explanation that expands on bullets with context and examples",
      "examples": ["example1", "example2"],

      "layout": "suggested animation style",
      "subtopic_type": "definition|comparison|process|advantages_disadvantages|case_study|timeline|classification|principles"
    }
  ]
}

IMPORTANT: 
- Do not include markdown fences or any text outside JSON
- Ensure all text is clean, professional, and free of question marks
- Make narration significantly more detailed than bullet points
- Vary subtopic types to avoid repetition
- Keep slides visually clean and non-overlapping
- Optimize content for video viewing and narration timing
- Ensure smooth flow between slides for video presentation
